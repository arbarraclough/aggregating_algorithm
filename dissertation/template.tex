\begin{abstract}
  This dissertation investigates how well humans generate objectively random binary sequences by evaluating human-generated sequences against true randomness using a variety of statistical methods, as well as assessing the predictability of such sequences using the Aggregating Algorithm, inspired by Markov Chains.
  
  The study is designed with a within-subject approach and makes use of a web application to allow subjects\textemdash{}primarily postgraduate students at Royal Holloway, University of London\textemdash{}to input binary sequences sequentially. As the subject enters their sequence, the bits are analysed by various ``Experts'', each of whom make their own predictions on the next bit in the sequence prior to the subject pressing a key. These predictions are then mixed using the Aggregating Algorithm to form a single prediction which is then compared against the observed outcome entered by the subject.
  
  This study measured various dependent variables, including the frequences of 0s and 1s (Heads and Tails), run lengths, and predictions from a variety of experts as well as the algorithm itself. The data gathered was evaluated using chi-square goodness-of-fit tests and by analysing the regret associated with each Expert/Learner to compare the generated sequences to statistically random processes. In summary, the Aggregating Algorithm's performance was evaluated, revealing that human-generated sequences do suffer from biases and are, therefore, predictable to a statistically significant extent better than is possible with random guessing.\newline\newline

\section*{Acknowledgements}
While the contents of this report are based on my work, none of this would have been possible without the patience and mentorship of my supervisor to whom I am extremely grateful. It was your advice, clear explanations, and expertise that made this project what it is now and something that I am incredibly proud of.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the group of friends who made this academic year possible, namely Cougar Tasker, Einstein Ebereonwu, Hayden Amarr, Mohammadreza Yazdian, Niraj Jain, and Ray Mahbub, without whom I would have struggled to maintain my discipline and motivation.
