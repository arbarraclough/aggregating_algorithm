\section*{Acknowledgements}
While the contents of this report are on the basis of my own work, none of this would have been possible without the patience and mentorship of my supervisor Dr. Yuri Kalnishkan to whom I am extremely grateful. It was your advice, clear explanations, and expertise that made this project what it is now and something that I am incredibly proud of.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the group of friends who made this academic year possible, namely Cougar Tasker, Einstein Ebereonwu, Hayden Amarr, Mohammadreza Yazdian, Niraj Jain, and Ray Mahbub, without whom I would have struggled to maintain my discipline and motivation.
