  abstract = {This paper resolves the problem of predicting as well as the best expert up to an additive term of the order o(n), where n is the length of a sequence of letters from a finite alphabet. We call the games that permit this weakly mixable and give a geometrical characterisation of the class of weakly mixable games. Weak mixability turns out to be equivalent to convexity of the finite part of the set of superpredictions. For bounded games we introduce the Weak Aggregating Algorithm that allows us to obtain additive terms of the form Cn.}

abstract = {We consider the following problem. At each point of discrete time the learner must make a prediction; he is given the predictions made by a pool of experts. Each prediction and the outcome, which is disclosed after the learner has made his prediction, determine the incurred loss. It is known that, under weak regularity, the learner can ensure that his cumulative loss never exceedscL+alnn, wherecandaare some constants,nis the size of the pool, andLis the cumulative loss incurred by the best expert in the pool. We find the set of those pairs (c, a) for which this is true.}
